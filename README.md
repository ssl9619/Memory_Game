# Why is it called Joker?
To answer this question is to answer the reason I made it so I'm going to explain all of that as briefly as I can:
I was inspired by an assignment given to some of my fellow students (friends) in their Introduction to Computer Science class. The assignment that they were given was to create a memory game which in class they called joker (for some reason) and so to stick to the spirit of the assignment I also called it Joker.

### However...

Unlike my friends in said class, they coded in Python but I don't know how to use Python. Instead, I picked a language that I don't really know how to use but know more than Python which was C#.

At this present moment C# acuity is far more important than Python because it relates to my job as a research assistant that is using Unity and this was a task which I felt was manageable and also fun. It really was fun to make this program.

## My Process

In creating this simple game I did improve my knowledge of C# syntax above all things but it was also something fun to do over the weekend. I started first with figuring out how to use C# on VSC then from there learn't a little bit about how to write functions in C#, how to print to the console, how to read from the console, etc. Overall the little things that I learned at the beginning really focused on the syntax and fortunately the syntax is close enough to C++ and Java that I had nearly no difficulty picking it up.

I did, however, have difficulty with creating the game. For my previous project C++ Chess (which I also started because it was my friends' assignment) it was far more complex and I was far more confused on how to start so I created a flow chart and thought a lot but didn't get much done in the beginning. When I ended up showing what I managed to complete to my friend and he showed me what he'd done I realized that I had my process all wrong. I felt and still feel that the ideas I had about the flow of the game, having a pieces class and whatever other programming things was good but my mistake was trying to do those things first without even having a grid or taking inputs from the user.

So for this project that was my goal: Start from the same spot as the player. As I was slowly picking up arrays in C# I ended up making the grid and just a lot of functions for printing. Later on I would take in inputs from the user and input verification, it was there I learned about the question mark syntax. In the moment it was very confusing but it makes a lot of sense now and even though its just a little new syntax thing for me I am glad I learned about it. Little wins was a recurring theme throughout the creation of this project. 

After input verification I went straight to trying to randomize the letters on the board. My first few attempts did not work, BUT! Because I had started from the users' start (which really seems obvious when I say it now) I could immediately debug it instead of confuse myself (I don't know how I've been able to finish anything).

I'm not going to go into the details of how I got the randomizing to work or anything else like that because to be honest it probably wasn't the ideal method. I tried my best to use as little outside input for this project and where I did use ChatGPT for instance I referenced it (I only used it for a ClearLines function and to debug my input verification).

## Final Remarks

I'm glad I finished this project and I'm happy that I've been able to finish it fairly quickly by my standards.
